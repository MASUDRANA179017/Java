To connect to a MySQL database in Java and create a simple API, you can follow these steps. I'll guide you through:

Set up your MySQL connection in Java using JDBC.
Create CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a MySQL database.
Use a Java framework (e.g., Spring Boot) to expose these operations via REST APIs.
Prerequisites:
MySQL installed on your machine.
JDK installed.
Spring Boot (optional, but recommended for making APIs easily).
A MySQL database created for testing (e.g., products_db).
